## Workflow Rules

### Pull Requests
- After pushing a branch, always create a PR using `gh pr create` — do NOT just push and leave it.
- Full workflow: commit → push → `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
- Pushing a branch does NOT automatically create a PR. The PR creation is a separate, required step.
